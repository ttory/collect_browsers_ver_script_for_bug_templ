Instructions for the initial version of the PowerShell script to gather browser versions installed on your computer and incorporate them into a predefined template:

1. Within the script, modify the $browsersNames variable to include the names of the browsers you typically use for testing on your machine.
2. Optionally, adjust the template within the script according to your preferences.
3. Prior to running the script, execute the command `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process` in PowerShell. Note that this policy will revert to its default setting once you close the terminal.
